            <h2>Polished Copy (for your games)</h2>
            <p>Over the past few years, I've helped a number of board game creators polish their game copy for publication.
                Some of the more notable games I've provided copyediting and proofreading for include
                <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/169786/scythe">Scythe</a>,
                <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164775/monstrous">Monstrous</a>, and
                <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/197376/charterstone">Charterstone</a>.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I've also been a proofreader on several books, including
                <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920013464.do">Myths of Innovation</a> by Scott Berkun,
                as well as Kathy Sierra's
