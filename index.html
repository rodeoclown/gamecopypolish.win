            <h2>Polished Copy (for your games)</h2>
            <p>Over the past few years I've been helping board game creators polish the rules, story, and other text (or "copy") in their games to get them ready for publication.<br/>
            Some of the more notable games I've provided copyediting and proofreading for are
                <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/169786/scythe">Scythe</a>,
                <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/329465/red-rising">Red Rising</a>, and
                <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/197376/charterstone">Charterstone</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've also proofread several books, including
                <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920013464.do">Myths of Innovation</a> by Scott Berkun,
                as well as Kathy Sierra's
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Making-Awesome-Kathy-Sierra/dp/1491919019">Badass: Making Users Awesome</a>.

He has an exceptional eye for typos, stylistic consistency, and mechanical cohesion. He has worked on nearly all of our games, and I will gladly work with him more in the future."<br/>
